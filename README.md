# Study Groups for 2019 Summer Residency

Each individual directory represents a weekly study group. These can likely be done in any order, but we did them as follows:

1. [SegWit](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/study-groups/tree/master/segwit)
2. [Mining and Network Propagation](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/study-groups/tree/master/mining-network-prop)
3. [P2P](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/study-groups/tree/master/p2p)
4. [Wallet Development and PSBT](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/study-groups/tree/master/wallet-psbt)
5. Payment Channels and Intro to Lightning
